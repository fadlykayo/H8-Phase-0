Welcome everyone!:blush:

## About Me

>_I am a highly motivated, well-organized and competitive person with many experiences in team and project management, as well as organizational leadership._

>_However, although my background study was electrical engineering, computer science and programming are what I enjoy the most. I spend most of my free time to be excelled on this field. Lately, I have joined a 4 months intensive programming boot camp that gives me the comprehensive view about what I can do as a full stack web and app developer for the rest of my career. I have also gained experiences in developing some mobile and web games when I was an intern at Fluffy Fairy Games back then in Karlsruhe, Germany as a Quality Assurance._

>_On my school and college year, I have always been a class and organization’s representative for 9 years straight. I love to challenge myself to find new experiences, meet new friends and adapt in a new environment._

>_In general, I am a well-planned and coordinated person, especially in programming. Exploring new technologies, developing games, webs and apps have always been my interest._

>_I am open to anyone who would share the same passion to develop something together from scratch. Feel free to get me in touch!_

>_Pardon for the messiness in my READMEs. Haven't had the time to tidy them up. But soon I will, promise!_

Here’s an overview of Markdown syntax that you can use anywhere on [GitHub.com](www.github.com) or in your own text files.

### Headers

```
# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag
```

### Emphasis

```
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_
``` 

### Lists  
##### Unordered

```
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
```

```
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
   * Item 3a
   * Item 3b
```

### Images

```

### Links

```
1.  http://github.com (automatic!)
2.  [GitHub](http://github.com)
```

### Blockquotes

> We're living the future so the present is our past.

### Inline code

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.
