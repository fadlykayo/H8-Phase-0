## Syntax Examples
Hereâ€™s an overview of Markdown syntax that you can use anywhere on [GitHub.com](www.github.com) or in your own text files.

### Headers

```
# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag
```

### Emphasis

```
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_
``` 

### Lists  
##### Unordered

```
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
```

##### Ordered

```
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
   * Item 3a
   * Item 3b
```

### Images

```
Format: ![Alt Text](url)
Example: ![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)
```

### Links

```
1.  http://github.com (automatic!)
2.  [GitHub](http://github.com)
```

### Blockquotes

> We're living the future so the present is our past.

### Inline code

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.
