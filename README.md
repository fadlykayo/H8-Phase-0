Hi everyone! :blush:

## About Me

_I am a highly motivated, well-organized and competitive person with many experiences in team and project management, as well as organizational leadership._

_However, although my background study was electrical engineering, computer science and programming are what I enjoy the most. I spend most of my free time to be excelled on this field. Lately, I have joined a 4 months intensive programming boot camp that gives me the comprehensive view about what I can do as a full stack web and app developer for the rest of my career. I have also gained experiences in developing some mobile and web games when I was an intern at Fluffy Fairy Games back then in Karlsruhe, Germany as a Quality Assurance._

_On my school and college year, I have always been a class and organization’s representative for 9 years straight. I love to challenge myself to find new experiences, meet new friends and adapt in a new environment._

_In general, I am a well-planned and coordinated person, especially in programming. Exploring new technologies, developing games, webs and apps have always been my interest._

_I am open to anyone who would share the same passion to develop something together from scratch. Feel free to get me in touch!_
