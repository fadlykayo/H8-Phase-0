# Fadly Kayo's Github Profile
Hello everyone! :blush:

## About Me

_I am a highly motivated, well-organized and competitive person with many experiences in team and project management, as well as organizational leadership.

My career as software developer started when I was in Germany and work as an intern in a game company and made my own mobile game with Unity3D Game Engine. Since then I spend most of my free time to be excelled on software development and programming, although my background study was electrical engineering.

In November 2016, I joined a 4 months intensive programming boot camp that gives me the comprehensive view about what I can do as a full stack web and app developer for the rest of my career.

The experiences in team and project management came along since I started working in a software development house in Jakarta. The company handles a lot of interesting projects from all kind of sources like startups, corporates and even from government. The best place to gain skills and experiences for a programmer like me who seek new challenges and projects.

When it's about coding, I am very structured and organised. I like to review the way I am coding from time to time and improve myself.

Outside the field programming, I love to develop games, including card games and board games, teaching others, meet new friends and watch series.

I am open to anyone who would share the same passion or to anyone who would like to have a talk with me about anything.

Feel free to get me in touch :)._
