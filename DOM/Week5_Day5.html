          In a time of strife between God, humans, and demons...
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Scarred during the gruesome war and avoiding total destruction altogether, God, humans, and demons manage to enter into a truce...
          <br/>
          <br/>
          But after 1,000 years of fragile and forged peace in Lorsania...
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The lengthy peace eventually led the humans to forget their memories of the scars and hardship from the war. As they forgot faults of the past, selfishness, corruption, and arrogance slowly spread throughout the land...
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Finally, the balance of peace broke and strange occurrences started happening. There came a strange howl from the boundaries that divided God, humans, and demons. Peaceful creatures became aggressive and attacked innocent villagers. Violent earthquakes, great hail storms drove some species to the brink of extinction...
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The mysterious legend of demons were rediscovered...
